<h2>Tree Planting: A Story of A High School Eco-Warrior</h2>

<img src="img/me.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">

<p>
As a student passionate about the environment, I decided to utilize ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to advocate for tree planting within my school community. I believed that by harnessing the power of technology, I could reach a wider audience and inspire fellow students to take action.
</p>

<p>
To kickstart my initiative, I joined a social media campaign called "Plant a Billion Trees" facilitated by The Nature Conservancy. It's a massive initiative to bring back forests. To mitigate the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, they aim to plant one billion trees worldwide. By entering a certain gift amount, I can already help to support their movement to plant more trees and restore our forests.

<p>
Moreover, I frequently used the Ecosia browser, which is a search engine that starts planting trees with every search and it donates the bulk of its expendable funds to tree-planting organizations around the globe. The Berlin-based company generously contributes 80 percent of its earnings to international tree-planting initiatives. Over 91% of a million trees have been planted as a direct result of this site.  Sixty million trees were planted by the company by the end of June 2019. Through this browser, I felt like that every search that I have is valuable as it contributes to the siteâ€™s profit which in turn they donate for tree planting.

<p>
To encourage active participation, I joined an organization that focuses on the environment. Through the YES-O club, I was able to join tree planting last 2021 which I and my friends participated. It was held at Bincungan Mangrove Site, Tagum City and we really enjoyed that activity as we felt satisfied and fulfilled that we contributed something for the betterment of our nature. As the pandemic was at still its peak, our meetings were held online but the bond between the members was strengthened as we are going towards the same goal, which is to restore our Earth. Through our collective efforts, we managed to plant a significant number of trees within our school premises and surrounding areas.

To further enhance engagement, I also joined the Lend a Hand Balik Eskwelahan last year which was for the preparation for the reintroduction of limited face-to-face classes on Monday, March 21, 2022. We clean every sector of the school so we can provide a safer and cleaner learning environment. Furthermore, to foster a sense of community, I joined online tree-planting webinars, which there invited local environmental experts to share their knowledge and experiences. These virtual events allowed students to learn practical tree-planting techniques, ask questions, and gain insights into the environmental challenges we face.
</p>

<p>
The impact of our ICT-driven advocacy campaign was remarkable. Students became enthusiastic participants, actively sharing their tree-planting achievements and encouraging their peers to get involved. The campaign not only increased awareness about the importance of trees but also inspired students to take tangible actions, such as organizing tree-planting events in their neighborhoods and participating in local conservation initiatives.
</p>

<p>
By utilizing ICT tools, we were able to harness the power of social media, mobile apps, and virtual events to advocate for tree planting. The campaign not only educated and empowered students but also created a sense of environmental responsibility and community engagement. It was a gratifying experience to witness the positive impact of ICT in promoting a greener future among fellow students.
