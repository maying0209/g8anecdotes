<h2>Welcome to Eco-8!</h2>

<p>
Eco-8 is a group that advocates actions that is beneficial to our environment.
Through our simple ways, we can take small steps together towards restoring 
our Mother Earth. Here, we share our own stories on how we were able to use ICT as a tool to further widen our reach of our chosen movement that is related with the environment.

<p>
We must take care of Mother Earth, for without her, we would not have a home in which to live. 
The survival of our home planet requires that we get the word out.

The Earth has everything necessary to support life, both living and nonliving. 
Our planet's state has deteriorated due to human interference, 
which has caused permanent damage to the environment.

A healthy environment can help improve our quality of life, thus caring for this planet 
is a good way to boost our own sense of fulfillment. We must all do everything we 
can to make people more concerned about Earth, our shared home.

<p>
Through our "Care for u, Care for Mother Earth" Advocacy, Eco-8 wants to encourage people to
carry out simple actions that are helpful to our environment. Although these acts are not big, but we believe
that with our collective single efforts, we can achieve to have a greener Earth.
