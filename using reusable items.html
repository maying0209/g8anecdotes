<h2>Why Use Disposable When We Can Reuse: How ICT Encourage Me To Reutilize Items</h2>

<p>
Plastic and paper bags are widely used in today's society. Its packaging is seen everywhere from grocery stores and corner shops to fast food joints and checkout counters. I learned as I got older just how important they were to us. It's steadily killing off Earth, and we have no idea. Many of us take it for granted because we've used it for so long, but this is a mistake. When I was in elementary school, I learned that plastic bags are a major contributor to climate change and global warming. My teacher emphasized to me that we can use eco-bags and the reusability of it is one of their main advantages. These roomy reusable bags are great for carrying plenty of groceries and other goods. The low cost and low quality of most plastic bags means that they shatter readily. However, there is a chance to save money, time, and resources by switching to reusable bags.

The importance of ICTs in my decision to use environmental bags cannot be overstated. Awareness of environmental issues, such as the need to reduce plastic waste, can be effectively spread using ICT platforms like social media, websites, and online news channels. Folks can learn about the environmental impacts of single-use plastic bags and about sustainable alternatives like reusable bags through these mediums. Which allowed me to learn more about the importance of eco-bags and their existence. There has been a recent upsurge in online campaigns and movements that promote the use of eco bags, made possible by the widespread availability of ICTs. Online petitions, social media, and other forms of digital activism can help get the word out to a wider audience, encouraging more people to become involved in the cause and talk about their own positive experiences with using green bags.
