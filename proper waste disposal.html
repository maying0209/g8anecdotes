<h2>Don't Dump the Waste to Mother Nature: I Throw It Properly</h2>

Lawrence was a person who cared much about the environment, and he resided in a small town. He has always been concerned about the environmental consequences of trash around the entire globe. To make a difference, Lawrence used ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to spread the word about the importance of appropriate trash disposal and to have a movement to create change for our environment.

<p>
ICT has always been a great help in assisting me to encourage on doing the act of properly disposing of waste. When I was 11, I watched a Sineskwela episode on my mom’s phone and it tackles waste. Before, I cannot thoroughly comprehend what they shared but now, I fully understand that with waste being properly disposed of, our environment is cleaner, meaning there are fewer health risks and hazards around to affect us. This includes not having our surroundings polluted and, instead, ensuring that our society remains as healthy as possible. It also lessens the chances of illness and diseases being spread through the air, reducing the risk of respiratory illnesses. Also, it ensures that toxic products are not being led into our waterways, which can pollute our water and stop us from having a clean water system.
</p>

<p>
I think the existence of ICT itself has encouraged me to be knowledgeable about the importance of proper waste disposal. Without it, I have always known that ignorance will remain and probably, and I’ll be able to destroy our nature unconsciously by throwing garbage anywhere. Moreover, seeing numerous posts related to the deterioration of our environment due to improper segregation of waste has awakened my inner self that we should act now before it's too late.
</p>

<p>
Hence, I utilized ICT specifically social media to share my thoughts regarding proper waste disposal and how can we be able to help our nature through simple things such as throwing our garbage properly. With the wide reach that ICT has, I know that it is capable to send my message to whomever it can reach and hopefully, they could also encourage my movement toward restoring Mother Earth.
