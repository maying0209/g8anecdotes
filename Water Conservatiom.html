Due to my interest in water conservation and the potential of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), I utilized this technology to create positive change within my community. 
</p>

<p>
I decided to use a program called "DropCountr," available for free online, to help me get started with my aim to conserve water. The software helps users easily view their daily water consumption using simple graphs and tables as part of the platform's attempt to educate consumers, like me, about water use and water scarcity. I can see how my water consumption stacks up against that of my immediate neighbors and the entire neighborhood. Dropcountr provides customers with granular insights about their water usage, including the financial implications of their daily water consumption. Dropcountr keeps tabs on my water usage and provides individualized cost estimates and tips for economizing.  In order to reduce water consumption, I can establish short-term goals for each day, week, and month to utilize wisely water.

To deepen understanding and engagement, I often shared posts relating to water conservation. These will help provide valuable insights, practical tips, and an opportunity to disseminate information about the importance of water conservation. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are the social media apps I utilized to convey my intention of saving every drop of water as I want to remind many individuals that we are very lucky to have access to clean water.
</p>

<p>
My initiative to promote change through the use of technology had a major impact. A lot of people began to see the importance of conserving water wherein, the reach and participation of the social media campaign far beyond that of our school, motivating others to get involved and adopt sustainable habits.
</p>

<p>
By doing so, I was able to equip my fellow students with the information and resources they needed to promote water conservation. It was quite satisfying to see people's actions shift in positive ways, such as by decreasing their water use and becoming more conscious of the value of water conservation. I know that through these small efforts, it can more than just change people's habits; it may also create a culture of environmental responsibility and motivated a community to work together for a better tomorrow.
